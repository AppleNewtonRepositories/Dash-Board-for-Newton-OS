To use the panel tab proto:1) The tabs should overlap each other by 2 pixels.	They should overlap top of the clView that	bound the prefs area by 2 pixels also.	2) The tabs handle activating themselves, with the built-in	TabActivate() method, which sets the color of the view. 	The color is controlled by the two slots tabInactiveFIll and	TabActiveFill. The tabs also keep track of whether they are	active or not by setting the TabIsActive slot.	3) The tabActivateScript and tabDeactivateScript slots contain	the methods called on activate/deactivate; these are the	methods you shoudl override to tell the tabs what to do. This	is also where you should deactivate the other tabs.
